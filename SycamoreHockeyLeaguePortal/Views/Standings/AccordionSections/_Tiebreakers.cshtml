<h5>Group H2H Standings</h5>
<p>
    In this tiebreaker, the tied teams are sorted in descending order of their win percentage and W-L record against the other tied teams.<br />
    <span class="text-danger"><strong>Note:</strong></span> This tiebreaker only applies if all of the teams in the tie have played each other at least once. If this criteria is not met, proceed to Step 2 for 3-way ties or larger ("regulation wins").
